Course Description 
This philosophical perspective fulfills three main goals: 
1) In general, this course serves as an introduction to philosophical thinking. Instead of frontloading 
this course with the fundamentals of philosophy—key philosophical concepts like nature, free will, 
knowledge, ethics, beauty, etc.—and then explicating their relevance for everyday experience, and 
instead of marching through the history of modern philosophy chronologically, this course takes a 
different approach. The course insists that newcomers and more experienced students of philosophy 
alike can acquire an appreciation for the vocation of the philosopher by first thinking about their own 
lives and/or the lives of other young adults. Neither children nor full-fledged adults, teenagers find 
themselves in an intermediary time in their own lives and an intermediary space within society. It is the 
condition of in-betweenness that will play a central role in this course’s lectures. 
2) More specifically, this course is an introductory intellectual history of German philosophy since 
1900. Unlike many introductory courses that begin with the French father of modern philosophy, René 
Descartes (1596-1650), this course instead focuses primarily on some, though not all of the most 
influential German philosophers to emerge in the twentieth century. Why necessarily German 
philosophy and why just the twentieth century? While older German philosophers like Immanuel Kant 
(1724-1804), G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831) and Karl Marx (1818-1883) certainly made some of the most 
lasting impacts on world philosophical thought, more recent German philosophers of the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries are especially attuned to the dilemmas of modern life. While we will address 
how these more modern thinkers engaged their eighteenth- and nineteenth-century predecessors, our 
prime directive will be to see how more modern German philosophy can help us examine critically the 
triumvirate of modern youth cultures: sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll. We shall therefore forego 
proceeding chronologically and instead collect philosophical concepts around these three primary 
German 280 | Fall 2016 | Page 2 
concerns. Our discussions will therefore jump back and forth between two main strands in German 
thought: the philosophy of knowledge and the philosophy of being. 
3) In our age of hyper-utilitarianism, this course demonstrates how philosophy is useful beyond the 
classroom in the most concrete of ways. Most immediately, the course will use cinematic stories about 
young adults to illuminate philosophical concepts. Additionally, it will ask how German philosophy 
helps us think beyond the limits of both cinematic narratives about young adults as well as beyond the 
realm of our own lived experiences in order to uncover the conceptual possibilities and limitations of 
in-betweenness that is endemic to being a teenager. Philosophy will be understood then as a tool to 
think through rebellion and conformity in ways that young people and youth cultures seldom have. 
This course fulfills the following Gen Ed requirements: A&S Philosophical Perspective, Philosophical & 
Moral Reasoning & North Atlantic World General Education requirements. 
Readings & Screenings 
No prior knowledge of German is required to succeed in German 280. All readings and discussions 
will be in English. There will be on occasion German concepts that arise in discussion; you will always 
be supplied with English translations. Given the unique nature and content of this course, there is no 
commercially available textbook that covers all the material in this course. Each enrolled student must 
purchase a single coursepack from Student Stores. Additional mandatory and optional reading 
materials will be made available on the course Sakai site. 
Six films will be screened and discussed extensively in this course. All of these films will be screened 
collectively on Monday evenings (please see the syllabus for exact screening dates and times; the 
location will be announced in class and posted on Sakai). Students are obligated to view films prior to 
attending the lectures scheduled to take place after the slated screening. Films are also on reserve in 
the MRC and available through Netflix and other streaming sources.

Class Meetings 
The course will consist of: 
1.  a pair of weekly lectures intended to explain the philosophical readings and place them into a 
philosophical, historical and cultural context. It is in your very best interest to attend every single 
lecture. In addition to being intellectually demanding and equally entertaining, the lectures will be 
your key for unlocking the weekly readings. Borrowing notes from a peer will not convey the 
complexity of the lectures. You will be responsible for the content of all the lectures on the exams. 
Lectures and corresponding Powerpoint presentations will not be made electronically available. 
2.  one recitation/discussion section per week. You must be registered for a recitation section to obtain 
credit for this course. Students will meet with a section leader to discuss the assigned material and ask 
any questions that are relevant to that week’s work. Approximately one third of the exams will treat 
material dealt with in the section meetings. 
Papers, Exams, Participation 
Writing Requirements 
As a class that fulfills general education requirements, this course requires significant student writing 
over the course of the semester.  This requirement is met by the following: 
1. Every Monday you will be required to submit your answers to no more than 3 questions posted 
on the Sakai site that pertain to the next week’s assigned readings. These questions will be posted 
on the Sakai site no later than noon on Friday prior to the weekend before the new readings are 
discussed in class. Your responses must be typed and printed with your name, PID and Honor 
pledge that signifies your work is your own. You may discuss with peers what the questions mean, 
but you may not share your own answers with others. There will be a total of 14 sets of questions you 
will need to answer. Monday homework not submitted by the end of class will not be accepted 
late. 
2. Every Thursday or Friday (depending on when your recitation section meets) you will be 
required to submit your answers to no more than 3 questions that pertain to that week’s lectures. 
These questions will be posted no later than 1:30 pm on every Wednesday prior to that week’s 
recitation sections. Questions must be typed and printed with your name, PID and Honor pledge that 
signifies your work is your own. You may discuss with peers what the questions mean, but you may 
not share your own answers with others. There will be a total of 14 sets of questions you will need to 
answer. Friday homework not submitted by the end of your recitation section will not be 
accepted late. 
3. 2 film analyses of no more than 800 words, double-spaced. Dr. Langston will regularly use 
screened films to illustrate philosophical concepts. Your task will be to analyze 2 of the 6 films 
screened in class using other philosophical concepts discussed in class that Dr. Langston has not 
applied to the films of your choice. Your first film analysis is due no later than 5pm on February 26, 
2016. Your second film analysis is due no later than 5pm on Friday, April 1, 2016. Be sure your 
analyses are typed and printed with your name, PID and Honor pledge that signifies your work is 
your own. See the Sakai site for further guidelines for your film analyses. 
4. 1 6-8-page, double-spaced paper on one of six assigned topics, due by 5pm on Friday, April 
22, 2016. Papers should rely primarily on readings and materials discussed in lectures and 
German 280 | Fall 2016 | Page 4 
recitation sections. While permissible, the use of secondary sources from Davis Library is not 
required (see suggested readings on the last page of this syllabus). Late papers will not be accepted.
